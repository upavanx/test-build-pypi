## Command Line Interface for Intel速 Edgesoftware 

*edgesoftware* is a command line interface wrapper (CLI) that helps you manage [Intel速 Edge Software Hub packages](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/iot/edge-solutions.html). With these pretested and pre-validated packages you can create reliable, scalable AI applications for the edge.

### Troubleshooting

**Error: *edgesoftware* command may not respond after installation.**

To mitigate this issue, close the current terminal and open a new terminal. The command should work in the newer terminal.

**Error: *python3 -m pip install edgesoftware* may fail due to failed installation of cryptography package.**

To resolve this issue, upgrade pip to latest version using *python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip* and then retry the installation.

**Error: *edgesoftware install* command may fail first time giving error - missing esb_common.**

To resolve this issue, try edgesoftware install command once again. This time you should be able to install the modules.
